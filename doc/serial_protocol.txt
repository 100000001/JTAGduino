This file contains the specifications of the protocol used to communicate with
JTAGduino through the serial port.

The communication protocol distinguishes between the "device", which is an
Arduino implementing the JTAGduino interface, and the "host", which is for
example the PC that controls the JTAGduino through the USB port. The
communication is always initiated by the host. The host sends a command to the
device using subsequent bytes; the first byte is always a code identifying the
command. The device receives the command, executes the actions specified by the
command and prepares a sequence of bytes containing the response and sends it
back to the host. The first byte of the response is always a code indicating the
result of the operation.  The protocol does not try to implement reliability, it
is expected that the serial channel between the host and the device is ideal and
lossless.

Each command is specified in the following format:

<Command name>
    Description:
        <Command description>.
    Command structure:
        Byte 0: <command byte code> 
        Byte <x>: <field name>. <description>.
        Bytes <y-z>: <field name>. <description>.
        ...
        Length: <command length in bytes including command code byte>
    Response structure:
        Byte <0>: response code.
            <RESPONSE_CODE> (<response byte code>): <description>
        Byte <x>: <field name>. <description>.
        Bytes <y-z>: <field name>. <description>.
        ...
        Length: <response length in bytes including response code byte>

Interface Version
    Description:
        Retrieves the version of the interface protocol between the host and the
        device. If the host and the device implement the interface with the same major
        and minor numbers, they are completely compatible. A host and a device
        implementing two protocols with the same major numbers but different minor
        number can communicate with each other using only functionality present in the
        version with the lower minor number. A host and a device implementing two
        protocols with different major numbers are not compatible with each other.
    Command structure:
        Byte 0: 0x01
        Length: 1 Byte 
    Response structure:
        Byte <0>: response code.
            <RSP_OK> (0x00): command received correctly.
        Bytes 1-2: Minor number. A 16-bit value indicating the minor version number.
        Bytes 3-4: Major number. A 16-bit value indicating the major version number.
        Length: 5 Bytes
